2. My github account is a place where I can add or edit files I have placed into multiple respositories. 
3. The respository I created/ cloned is somewhere I will store future projects/ files and a place where I can manage them as well.
4. To clone a respository onto my desktop I opened up Github Desktop, choose the option to clone a repository, and finally I chose the location where I wanted the file which was my desktop.
